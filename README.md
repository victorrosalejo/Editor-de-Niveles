# Level Editor - Angry Birds Clone

This project is a **Level Editor** inspired by Angry Birds, developed with **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to **create and edit levels** using a graphical canvas-based interface, where they can add blocks, heroes, and villains, and customize their properties interactively.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Entity Creation:**  
    - **Blocks:** Add configurable blocks in horizontal or vertical orientation, with different materials (wood, glass, TNT).  
    - **Heroes & Villains:** Add characters with specific attributes (e.g., powers for heroes and calories for villains).

- **Properties Panel:**  
    - Edit real-time attributes such as name, dimensions, angle, static/dynamic state, and material or powers/calories depending on the type.  
    - Immediate visual update on the canvas when properties change.

- **Intuitive Interaction:**  
    - Visual selection indicator (black circle) around the currently selected entity.  
    - Drag & drop entities to reposition them.

- **Level Export:**  
    - Download the level as a **JSON** file for reuse or integration into other projects.
